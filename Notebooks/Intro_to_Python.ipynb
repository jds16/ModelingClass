    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are comfortable with using Jupyter notebooks, we can learn more about programming in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Programming?**   \n",
    "**Programming** is giving the computer a set of step-by-step instructions to follow in order to execute a task. It’s a lot like writing your own recipe book! For example, let’s say you wanted to teach someone how to make a PB&J sandwich:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather bread, peanut butter, jelly, and a spreading knife.\n",
    "2. Take out two slices of bread.\n",
    "3. Use the knife to spread peanut butter on one slice of bread.\n",
    "4. Use the knife to spread jelly on the other slice of bread.\n",
    "5. Put the two slices of bread together to make a sandwich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like that, programming is breaking up a complex task into smaller commands for the computer to understand and execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to communicate with computers, however, we must talk to them in a way that they can understand us: via a **programming language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of programming languages, but we will be using **Python** because it is concise, simple to read, and applicable in a variety of projects - from web development to mobile apps to data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we often compute many values that we want to save so that we can use the result in a later step. For example, let’s say that we want to find the number of seconds in a day. We can easily calculate this with the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$60*60*24=86499 seconds$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, let’s say that your friend Alexander asked you how many seconds there are in three days. We could, of course, perform the calculation in a similar manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(60*60*24)*3=259200 seconds$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But we see that we repeated the calculation in parentheses above. Instead of doing this calculation again, we could have saved the result from our first step (calculating the number of seconds in a day) as a variable."

    "**Variable Types**  \n",
    "Next, we’ll talk about a few types of variables that you’ll be using. As we saw in the example above, one common type of variable is the integer (positive and negative whole numbers). You’ll also be using decimal numbers in Python, which are called doubles (positive and negative decimal numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "A third type of variable used frequently in Python is the *string*; strings are essentially sequences of characters, and you can think of them as words or sentences. We denote strings by surrounding the desired value with quotes. For example, “Data Science” and “2017” are strings, while bears and 2020 (both without quotes) are not strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last variable type we’ll go over is the *boolean*. They can take on one of two values: True or False. Booleans are often used to check conditions; for example, we might have a list of dogs, and we want to sort them into small dogs and large dogs. One way we could accomplish this is to say either True or False for each dog after seeing if the dog weighs more than 15 pounds.\n",

    "Now that we’ve discussed what types of variables we can use, let’s talk about how we can combine them together. As we saw at the beginning of this section, we can do basic math in Python. Here is a table that shows how to write such operations:\n",
